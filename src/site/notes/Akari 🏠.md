Just my little corner on the internet to keep track of interesting algorithms I've come across in my competitive programming journey and possibly some write ups(/editorials) of popular problem sets(If I get the time to).

# About Me
A CS undergrad in my senior year from IIT Roorkee(India), that who has wasted all his college life in vain(chasing after someoneðŸ˜…) and has finally found something meaningful to do.
Credentials: Not any great things, but for what it's worth I'm an expert on Codeforces with max. rating in 1700s, hopefully Imma get my lazy ass to give some more contests and reach 1900s by the end of 2023.
